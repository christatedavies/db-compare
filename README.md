A simple script for comparing a master database against another

Chris Tate-Davies (chris@tatedavies.com)

Often I need to compare client's databases against a master template. And we used to use SQL Yog for that, but its a pain to keep using that. So I wrote this script to the work.

It avoids comparing the DB engine and charset as that is handled by the server installation. 

Feel free to use as you will.
